## 🌱 What is BiotechProject?

BiotechProject is an **open digital lab** that combines **biotechnology, health, and web development** into an integrated system designed to be:

- 🔍 **Scientifically reliable**
- 💻 **Technically robust**
- 🌐 **Accessible to everyone**, including users with disabilities
- 🤝 **Open to global collaboration**

It was created to show how technology can serve science and healthcare, while ensuring equitable access for all -- regardless of sensory, cognitive, or motor abilities.

It's a collaborative space for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to explore **how the web can become a tool for inclusion and scientific innovation**.

## 🎯 Target Audience & Strategic Vision

The BiotechProject is engineered for stakeholders who prioritize resilience as a clinical requirement:

* **Health Systems & Health Initiatives**: Designed to scale metabolic digital twins with zero server-side compute costs, leveraging high-performance Vanilla JS for complex client-side logic.
* **Global Health Equity**: Engineered specifically for users in low-connectivity regions, ensuring sub-second (0.3s) load times even on legacy devices through SRE-grade optimization.
* **Neurodivergent Patients**: Native WCAG AAA compliance and 'Comfort Mode' provide a cognitively safe environment for healthcare interaction, reducing sensory overload.
* **SRE & Systems Engineers**: A blueprint for "SRE-for-Humans," where performance metrics (95% aggregate score) are treated as a commitment to user inclusion and reliability.

## 🏗 Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This project follows a rigorous decision-making process to ensure enterprise-grade resilience and performance. Below are the core architectural pillars:

### [ADR-001] Zero-Framework Mandate
* **Decision**: Bypass modern frameworks (React/Angular/Vue) in favor of pure Vanilla JS (ES6+).
* **Rationale**: Eliminates the "framework tax" on the Main Thread. In health-critical contexts, sub-second interactivity is a clinical requirement, not just a metric. 
* **Outcome**: Initial bundle size **< 20KB** and TTI (Time to Interactive) of **0.3s**.
* **Validation**: [Detailed Engineering Log & Performance Metrics (Issue #12)](https://github.com/Gitechnolo/biotechproject/issues/12)

### [ADR-002] Stateless Edge & Client-Side Intelligence
* **Decision**: Migrate complex metabolic and biological synchronization logic entirely to the client side.
* **Rationale**: Guarantees **100% service availability** during network surges or backend outages. This ensures users have access to bio-data even in offline or degraded connectivity (3G/Edge) scenarios.
* **Outcome**: 85% reduction in backend infrastructure costs and native GDPR/HIPAA data sovereignty.
* **Validation**: [Strategic Equity Analysis & Resilience Report (Issue #13)](https://github.com/Gitechnolo/biotechproject/issues/13)

### [ADR-003] AI-Assisted SRE Auditing
* **Decision**: Implementation of a cross-validation orchestration between Gemini 1.5 Pro and GitHub Copilot for code review and security audits.
* **Rationale**: Overcomes individual LLM hallucinations by enforcing a multi-model "consensus" on type safety and architectural integrity.
* **Outcome**: 87% technical maturity score and automated 24h reliability checks.
* **Validation**: [Multi-Model Audit Protocol & Case Study (Issue #14)](https://github.com/Gitechnolo/biotechproject/issues/14)

## 📊 Technical Quality Monitoring & Architecture

The project implements an **advanced technological maturity tracking system** via GitHub Actions. As of **March 3, 2026**, the ecosystem maintains a **95% aggregate performance score** even under extreme network stress tests (150ms RTT / 4x CPU slowdown).

While environmental noise during simulated throttling can cause minor performance fluctuations in individual pages, this SRE-grade audit ensures that core clinical modules remain accessible and performant during peak-hour network instability.

📂 **Latest Audit Records:**
* 📄 **[SRE Performance Stress-Test Report - March 3, 2026 (PDF)](docs/biotech-performance-report.pdf)** ⬅️ *New* 
* 📄 **[Executive Summary: Metabolic Digital Twin Architecture (PDF)](docs/Metabolic-Digital-Twin-Executive-Summary.pdf)**

### Dashboard Features
* ✅ **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Score (0–100) and load times updated every 24h.
* ✅ **Resilience Intelligence**: Automated tracking of `optimized`, `compatible`, and `deprecated` states under stress.
* 💾 **Open Data**: Export analytics in JSON/CSV/PDF for third-party audits directly from the UI.

## 🌐 Accessibility

The site is **conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA** for all main pages.  
Conformance has been verified through:

- Automated audits (Lighthouse, axe, WAVE)
- Manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Full keyboard navigation (tab, shift+tab, enter, space, arrows)
- W3C code validation
- Direct code inspection for semantic structure and correct ARIA usage

The project is **partially conformant with Level AAA**, particularly in:
- Color contrast (most text exceeds 7:1 ratio)
- Hierarchical heading structure
- Use of descriptive alternative text

However, some AAA criteria are not applicable or required in the current context (e.g. video captions, extended plain language).

### 🔍 Advanced Accessibility Features

- **DNA Scanner & Audit**: Interactive module with structured PDF Report generation, bilingual `aria-label`, and secure focus management  
- **HUD & Dynamic Tooltips**: Instant scientific explanations with text descriptions and percentage intensity values for all data points  
- **Circadian Synchrony**: Content adapts to time and season (axial tilt), reducing cognitive load via biological context-aware advice

## 🌍 Multilingual Management (i18n)

BiotechProject supports **multiple languages** through a **modular, lightweight, and accessible** translation system, designed to work seamlessly on static pages hosted on GitHub Pages.
"While text content is fully localized, scientific diagrams currently prioritize Italian/English versions to maintain technical accuracy during the project's rapid evolution."

The system enables:
- ✅ Real-time content translation  
- ✅ Persistent language selection across pages (like Wikipedia or Google)  
- ✅ Support for simplified versions for dyslexic users  
- ✅ Easy extension by contributors  

### 🧩 System Architecture

- **Modular JSON files**: each page has its own translation file in the `lang/` directory  
- **Common.json**: contains shared texts (menu, footer, language button)  
- **No backend required**: everything runs in pure JavaScript  
- **LocalStorage**: remembers the user's selected language  
- **`data-lang-key`**: HTML attribute to identify translatable elements  

### 📁 Structure of the `lang/` folder

`common.json` contains shared strings (menu, footer, etc.), page files contain per-page text.
