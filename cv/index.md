## KEY PROJECT: BIOTECHPROJECT  
Personal Initiative | Jul‚ÄìSep 2025  

Designed and developed a fully accessible, responsive, and high-performance educational portal for biotechnology, serving diverse audiences including students, researchers, and users with disabilities.

### ‚úÖ Technical & Accessibility Leadership  
- Achieved **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance**, with partial AAA alignment (e.g., Reading Level, Unusual Words, Text Spacing)  
- Built with **vanilla JavaScript, semantic HTML5, and CSS3**, ensuring maximum accessibility, performance, and resilience  
- Implemented **advanced accessibility features**:  
  - Dynamic keyboard navigation with focus trapping and visual indicators  
  - Full screen reader support (NVDA, VoiceOver) via ARIA 1.2 and structured alt texts  
  - Hidden data tables for screen reader access to charts and progress circles  
  - `<ruby>` tags for pronunciation and definitions of scientific terms (e.g., CRISPR, epigenetics) ‚Äî aligned with WCAG 3.1.3 and 3.1.5  
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` and manual "Comfort" toggle to disable non-essential animations  
  - Automatic high-contrast mode via `prefers-contrast: high`  
  - 5 dynamic color themes supporting protanopia, deuteranopia, and low vision (tested with NoCoffee)  
- Integrated **QRedshift**: automatic warm-color filter at night based on local time, reducing eye strain and supporting circadian rhythms  

### üåç Inclusive UX & Internationalization  
- Multilingual system (Italian, English) with automatic detection (`navigator.language`), manual switch, and persistence via `localStorage`  
- Simplified content versions with plain language (A2‚ÄìB1 CEFR) for users with dyslexia or cognitive disabilities  
- Accessible video player: no autoplay, keyboard-navigable, with scene descriptions and custom controls  
- Pronunciation support and acronym expansion (`<abbr>`) for technical terms (e.g., PCR, ATP)  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & Compliance  
- Load time **<1s on 3G**; Lighthouse scores: **100 Performance, 100 Accessibility**  
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions; automated audits with **axe, WAVE, Lighthouse**  
- SEO-optimized with JSON-LD structured data for enhanced discoverability and semantic clarity  
- Exportable performance and accessibility data in **JSON/CSV** for transparency and third-party audit  

### üì¢ Impact & Recognition  
- Public **Accessibility Statement** aligned with Italian law (D.Lgs. 106/2018) and EU standards  
- Cited in Italian accessibility communities as a reference for inclusive educational platforms  
- Tested with real users: positive feedback from screen reader users and individuals with low vision  
- Zero critical issues detected in automated + manual audits (axe, WAVE, manual keyboard/screen reader tests)

## LEARNING & GROWTH  
Self-taught Front-End Engineer focused on accessible, resilient, and human-centered web technologies. I learn by building, testing, and sharing ‚Äî with a deep commitment to inclusion and digital rights.

- **Foundations**: Certified Web Designer (early 2000s, private IT school) ‚Äî where I learned HTML, CSS, and the importance of clean code
- **Evolution**: Shifted to self-directed learning after recognizing the rapid obsolescence of frameworks. Focused instead on **core web technologies**: semantic HTML, accessible CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and user-first design
- **Web Accessibility**: Mastered WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA through hands-on implementation in BiotechProject, audit tools (axe, WAVE), and real user testing
- **Front-End Development**: Built a production-ready, high-performance site from scratch ‚Äî no frameworks, full control, maximum accessibility
- **Internationalization**: Designed and implemented a multilingual system with language detection, JSON translation files, and persistence
- **Salesforce & Cloud**: Currently learning Trailhead modules on Public Sector Solutions, Service Cloud, and Digital Transformation in Government

I believe that **skills are proven by what you build** ‚Äî not just by where you studied.  
And that **the best education is the one you design yourself.**

## WHY PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION?  
I believe digital transformation in government should not only be efficient ‚Äî it must be **inclusive, transparent, and human-centered**.  

BiotechProject was built on this principle: no one should be excluded from knowledge. That‚Äôs why I implemented WCAG standards not as a checklist, but as a **design philosophy**.  

Now, I want to bring this mindset to Salesforce ‚Äî to help Italian public administrations deliver citizen services that are not just digital, but **accessible to all**.  

From automating processes with AI to simplifying citizen journeys, I‚Äôm passionate about using technology to reduce bureaucracy and increase trust ‚Äî one accessible interaction at a time.
